## What is Condensat?

Condensat technologies is a software company, funded in 2020, located in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland.
Julien Guitton is its CEO.

## What does Condensat do?

We write a core banking software allowing anybody to be a bank.

## A bank? how can i be a bank?

Condensat software is an accounting software based on Bitcoin, Liquid and Lightning network technologies, pluggable to traditional payment networks.
When you install this software, you basically have a server where people can open accounts where they can deposit and withdraw their Bitcoins and liquid tokens.

## That's all? i run the software and i'm a bank?

NO, in our regulated world, in order to be a bank, you need a banking licence.

BUT, you can be your own bank, for your and your family's assets or even your company's assets.
Remeber that it's an accounting software and banks are just about accounting and payments.
You won't be able to connect to payment networks, as long as you need a banking licence to register to such networks.

## So, you work with banks?

We guide banks and any custodian financial institutions through the maze of building the right compliance to work with cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets.
We give banks tools to make easy, cheap and reliable auditings and verifications on their accounting with cryptography.
We want traditional banks to be able to use cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets.
We want neo/crypt banks to access traditional payment networks.
The important thing is:
*We want to reduce banking costs*
